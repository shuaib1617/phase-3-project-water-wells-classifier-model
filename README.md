### WATER WELLS CLASSIFIER README

#### 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW
In Tanzania, millions lack access to clean water, leading to health risks. Our team aims to predict water pump functionality, aiding the Ministry of Water and WHO in improving clean water accessibility.

#### 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Despite efforts, insufficient clean water access causes preventable deaths. Our task: predict water pump functionality to guide maintenance and resource allocation.

#### 3. OBJECTIVES
- Identify key factors impacting water pump functionality.
- Develop a robust machine learning model for accurate predictions.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improving clean water accessibility.

#### 4. DATA UNDERSTANDING
Dataset covers Tanzanian water points. Challenges include missing values and categorical data, addressed via preprocessing. Balancing classes within 'status_group' using methods like SMOTE is crucial for accurate predictions.

#### 5. MODELING
Utilized machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

#### 6. MODEL PERFORMANCE
Gradient Boosting exhibited superior performance (70.6% accuracy) with balanced precision and recall, making it the primary model for prediction.

#### 7. EVALUATION & CONCLUSION
While achieving a 70% accuracy rate, model enhancements are needed for precision in critical scenarios. Continuous training with updated data is recommended for improved robustness.

#### 8. RECOMMENDATION
Collaboration between WHO and the government, including urban water supply initiatives, could significantly contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

#### 9. NEXT STEPS
Future improvements involve exploring additional relevant features, refining ensemble methods, addressing class imbalance, and collaborating with domain experts for enhanced accuracy and applicability.
